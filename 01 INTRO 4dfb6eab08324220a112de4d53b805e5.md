## What is programming ?

<aside>
üí° Programming is just a way for humans to give instructions to computers.

</aside>

<aside>
üí° Machines speak the binary language, so humans created programming languages (that are between human language and machine language).

A programming language is just a set of instructions that can be given to a translator to translate them into binary code.

Programming language is said **‚Äúhigher-level‚Äù if closer to human language**, so naturally **‚Äúlower-level‚Äù if closer to machine language like Assembly.**

</aside>

<aside>
üí° To translate source code, we need an interpreter/compiler.

- An interpreter runs the code line by line.
- A compiler takes all the code at once and gives as output a binary executable file.
</aside>

## Python Interpreter

<aside>
üí° As interpreter, we have :

- CPython: the Official Python interpreter written in C
- Jython: written in Java
- PyPy: written in Python
- Iron Python: written for .NET
</aside>

<aside>
‚öô The CPython interpreter runs our source code and generates **bytecode** that is closer to machine code, then it uses the **CPython VM** that runs bytecode to generate binary code
and then the binary code gets run on our machine (the CPU).

## Python 2 vs Python 3

- Python came to life in 1990-1991.
- In 2008, a breaking update has been made by Guido van Rossum, who wanted to change a few things in the language he no longer liked. So was born Python 3.
- Since 2020, Python 2 is no longer supported.
