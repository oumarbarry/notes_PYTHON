# 03. BASICS 2

## Indentation in Python

## Conditional Logic (if, elif, else)

```python
if <condition1>:
	pass
elif <condition2>:
	pass
else:
	pass
```

### Truthy and Falsy

```python
# all the values below, will be evaluated as falsy value in a condition
None
False
0
0.0
0j
""
[]
{}
set()
range(0)
```

### Ternary Operator

```python
<return or run something> if <condition is true> else <return or run another thing>
```

### Short-circuiting

<aside>
üí° Short-circuiting happens when the interpreter is enough smart to say ‚ÄúI already did enough work‚Äù, like when evaluating the below condition :

```python
if <condition1> or <condition2>:
	pass
```

**if <condition1> is True, it will not evaluate <condition2> (it will ignore it).**

It applies either when using ‚Äúand‚Äù & ‚Äúor‚Äù keyword.

Short-circuiting is an internal optimization trick of the interpreter.

</aside>

### Logical & Comparison Operators

```python
# LOGICAL OPERATORS
and
or
not #--> it's a keyword but can also be used a function, which means: not 0 == not(0)

# COMPARISON OPERATORS
<
>
==
!=
<=
>=
```

### is vs ==

```python
v1 is v2 #--> checks if v1 & v2 are at the same location in memory

v1 == v2 #--> checks only if v1 & v2 have the same value (and by the way, when necessary the interpreter makes appropriate type conversion)

# a data structure is always created at a new location in memory, even empty, not like a simple type
[] is [] #--> return False because these 2 empty lists are created at a different locations in the memory
```

## Loops

### For Loops

```python
for i in iterable:
	pass

for k, v in dictionnary.items(): pass
for v in dictionnary.values(): pass
for k in dictionnary.keys(): pass
```

### What is an Iterable ?

<aside>
üí° An Iterable is a collection that can be looped/iterated over.

Iterated -> means that we can go one by one to check each item in the collection.

example of iterables: **list, dict, tuple, set, str, range object**

</aside>

### range()

```python
for _ in range(start=0, stop, step_over=1):
	pass

# _ is an authorized variable name, useful to use when you don't care about reusing that variable (like for example here, where we just want to loop over range()) 

range(10, 0, -1) #--> will range reversly so from 10,9,8..to 1
range(10, 0, -2) #--> will produce 10, 8, 6, 4 and 2

list(range(5)) #--> we can also use range like that to easily create list of number
```

### enumerate()

```python
# **enumerate:** helps to extract the index and the value of an iterable

for i, value in enumerate('Hi'): 	
		print(i, value)					

# will print out:
# 0 H
# 1	i
```

### While Loops

```python
while <condition_is_true>:
	pass
else:
	pass

# the else statement gets reached only if the condition is/becomes false (and by the way, if there isn't a break statement that gets reached in the while loop)
```

### break, continue, pass

```python
break #‚Äî-> to get out of a loop

continue #--> means rerun the loop / return to the top of the enclosing loop
```

## Dev Fundamentals 4: What's Good Code?

<aside>
üí° Clean, Readable, Predictable & DRY

</aside>

```python
# Clean Code Example

def is_even(num):							
	if num%2 == 0:												
		return True
	else:
		return False

# the above function, can be refactor as :
def is_even(num):
	return num % 2 == 0

```

## Functions

```python
def my_function(params):
	pass

print(my_function(args)) #--> will show where the function is stored in the memory

# FUNCTION'S NAMING CONVENTION in Python : snake_case

# functions helps us to keep our code DRY
```

<aside>
‚öô in a dream world, **a good function should do one thing really well** and should always return something

</aside>

### Parameters vs Arguments

<aside>
‚öô Parameter: it's the name of variables that are defined in the function definition

Arguments: are used as the actual values we provide to a function

so we say arguments when we call the function but params when we define the function

</aside>

### args and kwargs

```python
def f(*args, **kwargs):
		print(*args, **kwargs)

# args: give us access (inside the function) to **a tuple** of positional arguments

# kwargs: give us access to **a dictionary of keywords arguments**
```

### Params Order

```python
def func(pos_params, *args, default_params='some_value', **kwargs):
		pass

# Type of Params
#- Positional params: params that are required to be in the proper position (make code cleaner)
#- Keyword arguments: arguments that allows us to not worry about the position (increases the readability of code)
#- Default Parameters
```

### return

<aside>
üí° In Python, functions return **None** by default when the return keyword is not used in a function

</aside>

### Docstrings

```python
def my_function():
	''' Info: it's the docstrings info place '''
	print('python')

help(my_function)
print(my_function.__doc__)
```

### Scope

<aside>
‚öô SCOPE or said in other word, ‚Äú**what variable does the program have access to ?**‚Äù

- if a variable isn't inside a function, it's part of **the global scope**
- inside a function, we have what's called **local scope** (notice that function parameters are part of the local scope) it's because of memory, management of memory

- when a function finished running, all its local variables get deleted from the memory
- why scoping in Python ? scoping in python has been implement in Python for a better (automatic) memory management
</aside>

<aside>
‚öô Set of rules that the interpreter follows in order to check the existence of a variable :
1- start with local scope
2- if there is nothing in the local scope, is there a parent local scope ?
3- check to the global scope
4- check if the variable/function is an built-in python item

</aside>

### global keyword

```python
total=0
def count():								
	global total								
	total +=1									
	return total
											
count() #--> will return 1							
count()	#--> will return 2
```

### nonlocal keyword

<aside>
‚öô or how to say to the interpreter, ‚Äúhey I want to use a variable that is outside of my scope and that is not a global variable‚Äù

</aside>

### Dependency Injection

```python
def count(t):
	t+=1
	return t

print(count(count(count(0))))
```
