## What's is OOP ?

<aside>
üí° OOP is all about grouping up functionality and data into objects (that model the real world objects).

</aside>

<aside>
üí° OOP is a paradigm (i.e a way for us to think about our code and structure it in a way that is easier to write, extend and maintain).

OOP helps us to make code more manageable, more organized (as a real-life projects code will perforce get bigger and bigger).

</aside>

## Creation of our own class

<aside>
üí° A class is the blueprint of what we want to create.

Attributes = Properties.

Actions = Methods.

An object is an instance of a class (object = instance).

Saying ‚Äúa class has been instantiated‚Äù, simply means we have created an instance from it.

</aside>

```python
# naming convention of class : PascalCased & never plural

# FORMAT
# DEFINING A CLASS
class NameOfClass:
	attribute_de_classe = 'something'
	
	def __init__(self, param1, param2):
		self.param1 = param1
		self.param2 = param1

	def __str__(self):
		
	
	def method(self):
		pass

	def autre_method():
		pass
	
	@classmethod
	def class_method(cls = NameOfClass, other_params):
		pass
	
	@staticmethod
	def static_method(paramA, paramB):
		pass

# INSTANTIATE AN OBJECT
my_object = NameOfClass()

# example.py
class Player:
	count = 0

	def __init__(self, name, membership):
		self.name = name # object attribute
		self.membership = membership
		self.count += 1
	
	def run(self):
		return 'Ruuunnn'

player1 = Player("Alpha", True)
```

```python
# for accessing a class attribute **inside a class**, it's can either be preceded by self or NameOfClass: 
self.class_attr
**NameOfClass.class_attr**
# for accessing an object attr inside a class, it must **always** be preceded by self:
**self.regular_attr**
```

### **self**

<aside>
üí° ‚Äúself‚Äù refers to whatever is to the left of the dot (.) notation. It allows us to have a reference in a class blueprint to an object that hasn't been created yet.

‚Äùself‚Äù is mandatory as the first positional parameter for a method, if you ever predict that it's a method that can/will be called (by the programmer user).

</aside>

### @classmethod and @staticmethod

```python
# the only difference between @classmethod and @staticmethod is the fact that we don't have access to the class parameter (cls) in static method

@classmethod
def func(cls, other_param):
	# cls represents the class itself, per example PlayerCharacter
	return cls(other_param) # equals to PlayerCharacter(param)
```

## 4 Pillars of OOP

```python
# example.py

class User:
	def __init__(self, email):
		self.email = email

	def signin(self):
		pass

	def _autre():
		pass

class Wizard(User):
	def __init__(self, email, name, power):
		super().__init__(email)	# equals but better than: User.__init__(self, email)
		self.name = name
		self.power = power

	# here can come code for Wizard's class own method or methods that it shares with Userthat it overrides
```

### Encapsulation

<aside>
‚öô Encapsulation means packing things that have the same meaning (data, actions on these data), so that we can mimic what happens in the real world objects.

</aside>

### Abstraction

<aside>
‚öô Abstraction means hiding information and giving access to only what's necessary.

</aside>

<aside>
üí° **Public vs Private Variables :**

in Python, there is not true privacy, but there's the convention to put one underscore (_) before an attribute name to specify his privacy, like that : **_age**

</aside>

### Inheritance

<aside>
‚öô ‚Äú**object‚Äù** is the most base type, the most high-level class in python. Every class in Python inherits the ‚Äúobject‚Äù class.

</aside>

```python
isinstance(my_object, MyClass)
issubclass(Class1, Class2)
```

<aside>
‚ú® super() simply refers to the inherited class

</aside>

### Polymorphism

<aside>
üí° POLY means many, MORPHISM means form, so **polymorphism stands for many forms.**

The idea of polymorphism refers to how object classes can share the same method name but those method names can act differently based on what object calls them.

Polymorphism **is the ability to redefine methods/actions for the derived class**.

</aside>

## Object Introspection

<aside>
üí° In programming, introspection means the ability to determine the type of an object at runtime.

In an editor like VSCode whenever we type dot (.) in front of an object name, the editor will use behind introspection to list out all available methods and attributes of that object.

```python
dir(my_object) # also returns all the methods and attributes of the object
```

</aside>

## Dunder Methods

<aside>
üí° These **special magic methods give us the power to customize in-depth our classes**.

They allow us to change the behavior of a class, so we get a custom result when we call built-in functions on our object.

- some examples
    - __init__ : the constructor
    - __str__ : returns str representation of the object
    - __len__ : modify it to customize to result given back by the len(object) function on an object
    - __del__ : customize the result given back by the ‚Äúdel‚Äù statement
    - __ call__, __getitem__, __setitem__, __delitem__, ‚Ä¶
</aside>

```python
# example.py
class SuperList:
		def __len__():
			return 1000

s = SuperList();
print(len(s))
```

## Multiple Inheritance

```python
class Child(Class1, Class2, Class3):
	pass
```

<aside>
‚ú® With great power comes great responsibility.

So as with multiple inheritances, things get more and more complex, be aware of the inherited methods, be aware of the inherited data, be aware of the order of inheritance.

</aside>

### Method Resolution Order (MRO)

<aside>
üí° MRO acts as the solution that helps the interpreter to define in what order an object/class is going to inherit, using behind the algorithm named Depth First Search.

</aside>

```python
object.mro()
object.__mro__
```
