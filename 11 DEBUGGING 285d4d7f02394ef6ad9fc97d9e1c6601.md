<aside>
ðŸ’¡ The act of finding and removing bugs, errors, exceptions from our code is called debugging.

## WAYS to debug more efficiently

- Linting
    - IDEâ€™s like **PyCharm already has built-in linting**
    - for code editor like VSCode, we can install **pylint** or flake8
- the **print()** function : simple, quick and easy way to debug our code
- Python Debugger (PDB)
    
    [Python Debugging With Pdb - Real Python](https://realpython.com/python-debugging-pdb/)
    
    ```python
    # PDB is extremely useful because it allows us to interact with the code, TRY IT OUT LIKE BELOW
    
    import pdb
    
    def add(num1, num2):
    	pdb.set_trace() # this line will lauch the pdb interactive shell, inside it type 'help' for documentation
    	return num1+num2
    
    add(4,5)
    ```
    
- VSCODE built-in debugger
