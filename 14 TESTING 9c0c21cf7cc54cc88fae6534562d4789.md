## Unit Testing

<aside>
⚙ Unit Testing, is a method in software development, where individual units of source code such as functions are tested to see whether they work properly.

PS: With testing, it's common practice to try to break things until the function becomes perfect.

## Unittest

```python
# script.py
def do_stuff(num):
	try:
		if num or num!=0:
			return int(num)+5
		else:
			return "enter a number"
	except ValueError as err:
		return err

# test.py
import unittest
import script

class TestMain(unittest.TestCase):
	#check the unittest docs for all other assert methods
	def setUp(self):
		print("default function that will be run before the call of each test method")

	def test_do_stuff1(self):
		''' Comment that will be visible when we run python -mv unittest '''
		test_data = 10
		result = script.do_stuff(test_data)
		self.assertEqual(result, 15)

	def test_do_stuff2(self):
		test_data = "aejdsbd"
		result = script.do_stuff(test_data)
		self.assertIsInstance(result, ValueError)

	def test_do_stuff3(self):
		test_data = None
		result = script.do_stuff(test_data)
		self.assertEqual(result, "enter a fucking number")

	def test_do_stuff4(self):
		test_data = ""
		result = script.do_stuff(test_data)
		self.assertEqual(result, "enter a fucking number")

	def test_do_stuff5(self):
		test_data = 0
		result = script.do_stuff(test_data)
		self.assertEqual(result, 5)

	def tearDown(self):
		print("default function that will be run at the end of test method that we call")

if __name__ == '__main__':
	unittest.main()
```

```bash
# instead of running one test file only with:
python the_test_file_name.py

# we can run multiple test files (located in the same directory), at the same time with:
python -m unittest -v
```

## Writing Tests

<aside>
⚙ When it comes to tests because they don't go into production (it’s just for development purposes), **readability is the most important.**

So we don't care as much about not repeating ourself and making our code efficient, nice, and small, we don’t care. So **let's write really descriptive tests.**

The whole point of testing is to just simply look at code and try to find how it can be improved, find how it can be broken, how it can be simplified by breaking it into smaller units. 

Smaller units that can be tested to fix some errors that perhaps we wouldn't have thought about.

There's an infinite number of tests that we can write, so the idea is to write good quality tests that cover most of the cases.

Sometimes **depending on the job requirements, we may have to focus more on tests, and less on code**. Sometimes **we need to do things fast and don't have time to write test**.

But the more tests we have, usually means the more stable our code, is.
